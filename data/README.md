# Data

### Data
You can find the data here and can also use them to train your own model.

### How did I collect the data
Basically, I write some code that imitate human scrolling the X on Safari to extract the content. Then, I used OpenAI API to let ChatGPT-4o give me the prompts. You can find more details in X.py. This method is actually not really fast and has few limitaions, like I cannot scroll down when there are too many tweets on the tab (not really sure why did this happen). If you wish having more data or not wasting time on the collection of data. I recommend you to choose one of the following two methods, which is lot more easier. I want to challenge myself a little bit, so I collect all the data by myself.

### Some other ways to collect data
#### solution 1
You can also use [X api](https://developer.x.com/en) to collect data, which is lot more faster and efficient, but you need to pay for it. The free plan is literally unusable and the basic plan costs $200 per month.
#### solution 2
The most efficient way to collect data is using the data that has already been collected by others. For example, you can find almost all Trump's tweets on [Trump Twitter Archive](https://www.thetrumparchive.com).
