# Data

### Data
You can find the data here and can also use them to train your own model.

### How did I collect the data
Basically, I write some code that imitate human scrolling the X on Safari to extract the content. Then, I used OpenAI API to let ChatGPT-4o give me the prompts. You can find more details in twitter.py
